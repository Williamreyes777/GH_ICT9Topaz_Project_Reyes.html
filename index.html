			<td class="table-dark">Before you plug something into a socket, try to be courteous in ensuring that the wire hasn’t been torn or chewed up (in case you have any pets running around). Damaged wires can be a detrimental fire hazard and need replacing as soon as possible. Also, remember that wires do get hot when in use, so be sure to check your wire placement and avoiding passing them under a carpet or anywhere that could potentially catch fire.</td>

			<td class="table-dark">We get it, it’s nice having some candles lit up around the house to create a romantic atmosphere, or perhaps even getting the fireplace going to make your home feel even toastier on a cold winter evening. We aren’t going to tell you to avoid candles and fireplaces altogether, however we do encourage you to practice with caution. If you feel yourself dosing off, turn off all your candles beforehand, and if you have pets, keep these open flames out of their reach as much as possible..</td>

			<td class="table-dark">Fire extinguishers and blankets will be your best defence in the event of a fire breaking out. Every family member should know how to use a fire extinguisher, so in case something in your home does catch fire, it can be put out as fast as possible. Fire blankets are also very useful for putting out small fires before they become something larger and fiercer. There is nothing more devastating than losing all your belongings to a house fire. After all, your home is likely to be the source of many beautiful memories, and you owe it to yourself to protect it. Insure your home with MAPFRE Middlesea and rest assured that all your personal belongings would remain protected. </td>
